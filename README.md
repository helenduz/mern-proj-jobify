# [Jobify](https://jobify-24nl.onrender.com)

## Introduction
Jobify is a full-stack web application that helps you track your job applications!
After you register or log in, you will be able to:
* view/add/edit/delete your job applications
* look at statistics and graphs for your applications
* search and/or filter for particular job applications
* edit your user profile

Check out the deployed website to see it live! You will be able to choose "Just Show Me a Demo" in the login/register page if you do not wish to create your account.

Featuring a JWT user auth system, usage of advance React concepts like context/reducer, and implemented with modern best practices of full-stack applications, this project has been my favorite so far. Enjoy!
